## IdP Discovery (with SAML 2.0 IdP)

This page uses the [Okta Sign In Widget](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget) with [external IdPs](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/saml2/create-an-app-at-idp/) (OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0, flow shown below) configured with [IdP discovery with routing rules](https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/Security/Identity_Provider_Discovery.htm).

In this implementation, Okta acts as a SP (service provider) for an external IdP (identity provider).
